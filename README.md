By John R. Schermerhorn Jr. Organizational Behavior (10th Edition) Hardcover – January 18, 2008. Taking the Lead In one very important way, successful organizations are like flocks of geese. Geese fly in a 'V' formation, which provides the flock a substantially longer flying range (71% longer) than if each bird flew alone. Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of flying alone and quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird immediately in front. When the lead goose tires, it rotates back into the formation and another goose takes over at the point position. The lessons to be learned are clear: \*people can get where they are going more quickly and easily when they travel together with a common direction and sense of mutual assistance \*it pays to take turns doing the difficult tasks and sharing leadership roles because individuals in organizations are interdependent \*successful organizations in today's global environment are made up of people who are doing just that — working together to achieve a common goal
